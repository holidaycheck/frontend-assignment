# Frontend Assignment

### Please implement page in software stack of your choice with the following requirements:

* Assume that you have data already returned from JSON service. Structure of that JSON is up to you.
* Functionality of adding comments should be implemented - comment box doesn't have to look fancy, but user should be able to add a comment which then will be displayed on page. Note: This comment doesn't have to be stored on server - it can vanish after full page reload. 
* Thumbs-up/thumbs-down and stars are two separate things, one doesn't influence another in any way. This is also static content; it's not meant to rate the hotel, it's just displaying data. 
* Text should expand after clicking at any part of it. Collapsing text doesn't have to be implemented. 
* Font used is Open Sans - you will find it on Google Fonts.
* Thumbs up / thumbs down / stars are all part of Font Awesome.
* You don't have to use exact user pictures, you can grab random ones from e.g. https://randomuser.me/
* Header background image - pick whatever you want from Flickr or similar.
* It doesn't have to render on a server.
* HTML/Component (if used) structure is totally up to you.
* All required assets are located in assets folder ( logo + design ).
* Page doesn't have to be responsive. Layout doesn't have to be pixel perfect.
* It's only client side "application" (we used quotes, because it's only one page - hard to call it "application" ;)

Have fun!
